<a>This story starts on Halloween of 2010, when I was 3 years old. This was the night I had my first bite of candy corn. It was a life changing experience. Every year since that night, as soon as September rolled around, I would start scanning the aisles of every store I went into, searching for that familiar orange and yellow bag of candy corn. No other candy could compare to the unique flavor and nostalgic memories that candy corn brought me.<br><br>

  As I grew older, my love for candy corn never wavered. Friends and family members would poke fun at me for my obsession, but I didn't care. To me, candy corn was more than just a Halloween treat - it was a symbol of comfort, happiness, and pure sweetness in a world that could often be chaotic and evil. I soon realized that I was seemingly outnumbered when it came to my opinion of the delicious candy. Contrary to my experiences, many people seemed to despise my beloved candy corn. It was often labeled as overly sweet, waxy, and downright unappetizing. Despite these criticisms, my love for candy corn never wavered. In fact, it only strengthened my resolve to defend this misunderstood confection. The immature idea that candy corn was the worst Halloween candy angered me, and I knew I needed to do something. <br><br>

Around a year ago, the idea for this movement popped into my head. I realized that there was something I could do to help fellow candy corn lovers stand up, and together we could bring forth a new notion; candy corn is the superior candy. Over the past year, I have worked tirelessly to help bring candy corn lovers out of the shadows and into the light. Now we are ready to speak up about our opinions, and we refuse to be bullied. <br><br>

Candy corn lovers, I implore you to join me on this journey. Together, we can show the world the true power of candy corn and silence the non-believers once and for all. There is a reason why candy corn has been a Halloween staple for generations - it is superior.<br><br>

If you are a hater of candy corn, just know that you are wrong. We will prevail, and we will prove that candy corn is the best candy of all. Those of you that support the cause, I ask you kindly to donate what you can. Together we will reign supreme. Your help will not be in vain. <br><br>

Thank You.</a></center> </div>
