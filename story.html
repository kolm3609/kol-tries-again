<a>This story starts on Halloween of 2010, when I was just 3 years old. This was the night I had my first bite of candy corn - a triangular piece of heaven that would change my life forever. The sweetness exploded in my mouth, a flavor unlike anything I had ever experienced before. It was a life-changing experience, one that would shape my Halloween celebrations for years to come. Every year, as soon as September rolled around, I would start scanning the aisles of every store I went into, my eyes eagerly searching for that familiar orange and yellow bag of candy corn. No other candy could compare to the unique flavor and nostalgic memories that candy corn brought me. While my friends would excitedly grab their Reese's Pieces and Snickers bars, I would head straight for the candy corn, my heart racing with excitement.<br><br>

  As I grew older, my love for candy corn never wavered. In fact, it only grew stronger. Friends and family members would poke fun at me for my obsession, calling me the "candy corn kid." But I didn't care. To me, candy corn was more than just a Halloween treat - it was a symbol of comfort, happiness, and pure sweetness in a world that could often be chaotic and evil. It brought me back to a time when life was simpler, when my biggest worry was what costume to wear on Halloween. I soon realized that I was seemingly outnumbered when it came to my opinion of the delicious candy. Contrary to my experiences, many people seemed to despise my beloved candy corn. It was often labeled as overly sweet, waxy, and downright unappetizing. But I knew these people just didn't get it. They didn't understand the joy that candy corn brought me, the memories it conjured up. Despite these criticisms, my love for candy corn never wavered. In fact, it only strengthened my resolve to defend this misunderstood confection. The immature idea that candy corn was the worst Halloween candy angered me, and I knew I needed to do something.<br><br>

  Around a year ago, the idea for this movement popped into my head. I realized that there was something I could do to help fellow candy corn lovers stand up, and together we could bring forth a new notion; candy corn is the superior candy. We didn't have to hide in the shadows anymore, too afraid to admit our love for the tri-colored treat. Over the past year, I have worked tirelessly to help bring candy corn lovers out of the shadows and into the light. I've connected with others who share my passion, who understand the joy that candy corn brings. Now we are ready to speak up about our opinions, and we refuse to be bullied. We will no longer stand idly by as our beloved candy is trashed and bashed.<br><br>

  Candy corn lovers, I implore you to join me on this journey. Together, we can show the world the true power of candy corn and silence the non-believers once and for all. There is a reason why candy corn has been a Halloween staple for generations - it is superior. It's a candy that transcends age and time, a treat that brings people together. So don't be afraid to admit your love for candy corn. Let's stand tall and proud, our heads held high. Let's show the world that we won't be silenced, that our voices will be heard.<br><br>

  If you are a hater of candy corn, just know that you are wrong. We will prevail, and we will prove that candy corn is the best candy of all. Your negative comments and jokes will only fuel our fire, make us stronger. So keep hating, keep bashing our beloved candy. But at the end of the day, we will be the ones smiling, our bowls full of the tri-colored treat we love so much. 
It's more than just a candy, it's a way of life.<br><br>
  
Those of you that support the cause, I ask you kindly to donate what you can. Together we will reign supreme. Your help will not be in vain. Every donation, no matter how big or small, will bring us closer to our goal of proving the greatness of candy corn. So don't wait, donate now. Let's make a difference and show the world the power of candy corn.<br><br>

  Thank You.
